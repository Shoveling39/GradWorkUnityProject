This test is meant to measure auditory reaction times based on different types of auditory cues. These cues consist of musical, vocal and noisy sounds.

You will be asked to react to 10 sounds from each category. Whenever you press Enter to continue, be ready to press the Spacebar key to react to a sound!!! After each reaction, you will be prompted to press enter to continue onto the next sound or level.

There are 6 levels in total. The final 3 levels will contain background noise, which are meant to test whether they affect your reaction speed or not!

P.S.: If you feel like you are waiting for a long time until a sound comes in, it probably means it already played but you didn't hear it! You can then just press space to continue.

Important!!! After you are done, please check the GradWork_Data folder within the test file location and send me all of the excel files in there.
